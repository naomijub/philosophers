# philosophers

In ancient times, a wealthy philanthropist endowed a College to accommodate five
eminent philosophers. Each philosopher had a room in which he could engage in his
professional activity of thinking; there was also a common dining room, furnished
with a circular table, surrounded by five chairs, each labelled by the name of the
philosopher who was to sit in it. They sat anticlockwise around the table. To the
left of each philosopher there was laid a golden fork, and in the centre stood a large
bowl of spaghetti, which was constantly replenished. A philosopher was expected
to spend most of his time thinking; but when he felt hungry, he went to the dining
room, sat down in his own chair, picked up his own fork on his left, and plunged it
into the spaghetti. But such is the tangled nature of spaghetti that a second fork
is required to carry it to the mouth. The philosopher therefore had also to pick up
the fork on his right. When we was finished he would put down both his forks, get
up from his chair, and continue thinking. Of course, a fork can be used by only one
philosopher at a time. If the other philosopher wants it, he just has to wait until the
fork is available again.
